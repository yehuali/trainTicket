     * presented. Whilst the above exceptions are optional, an
     * <code>AuthenticationManager</code> must <B>always</B> test credentials.</li>
     * </ul>

     * above (i.e. if an account is disabled or locked, the authentication request is
     * immediately rejected and the credentials testing process is not performed). This
     * prevents credentials being tested against disabled or locked accounts.
